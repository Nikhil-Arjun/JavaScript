  A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.

  DOM

  The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML document.

  The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document(e.g. an element, text string, or comment).

  The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.
